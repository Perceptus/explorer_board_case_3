Here are a couple of pictures of the finished 3D printed case:

The case has two compartments. One for the Explorer Board + Edison ( the one with the guides on the walls! ) & one for the 2000mAh battery ( the larger one ). 

They should be arranged as shown on the picture so the battery connector does not get stuck in the case.

Happy #worldcreate day!
